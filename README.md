# ringer-sim

## Basic ideas from joint brainstorming:

Ringer has:
1. some basic ability to abstract the rhythm from the ringing.
2. some gaussian distributed noise in their sense of the rhythm.
3. some gaussian distributed noise in their ability to place their bell where they think it should be.
4. some ability to use rope sight, with ability to correct for oddstruckness.
5. ability to place their bell based on their abstract rhythm
6. ability ... based on hearing the bells ringing when they are pulling
7. ability to place their bell based on absolute delay since the last time their bell struck.
8. differing abilities on different bells
9. differing abilities to see bells on either side of them.
10. differing abilities to strike over large and small bells (using ropesight)
11. ability to lead, that is generally different from ability to strike over other bells.
12. differing ability to strike handstroke and backstroke.
13. tendency to make method errors
* different for each method
* might use ropesight to reduce errors
* susceptibility at calls
14. different ability to concentrate
15. reliance on weaker ringers being right
16. reliance on reliable ringers being right

## More subtle things that might be very hard to simulate
